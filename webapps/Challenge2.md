### Challenge 2: Customize your Home Page

Now that you understand all that html code you copypasted in the last challenge, we'll move a step further.

1. Change the title of the web page from `Bootstrap 101 Template` to `{Your Name} | My Personal Web Page`
2. Create a Bootstrap `.container` in the page between the `<!-- CONTENT STARTS HERE -->` and `<!-- CONTENT ENDS HERE -->` comment tags
3. Inside this `.container`, create 3 `.row`s.
4. The first `.row` will welcome the user to your web page. Bootstrap `.jumbotron`s are good for bold welcome messages
5. The seccond `.row` will contain biographical data
6. The third `.row` should contain information about work and/or school
7. If you're in the mood, add a fourth `.row` for fun, random stuff about yourself.
8. Unless you're daring with your design, your web page may end up looking like [this](http://nknj.github.io/)

**Important**

* Add at least one image to your page
* Embed at least one video from YouTube or audio track from SoundCloud
* Include a list of links to your online profiles, including GitHub if you have an account
* Is your page responsive? Head over to http://getbootstrap.com/css/ to learn about responsiveness. Look under "Grid System"
* Test your page on mobile by resiving your window. See if you like the layout


### Lecture

Again, some useful links from the Interwebs will teach you much more than I can on some important subjects.

The key word for this challenge is Responsive Design. The other key word is Documentation. Not only should you learn what responsive design is. You should know why it is necessary.

Also, if you managed to get through this tutorial, you should know your way round the Bootstrap documentation. You'll need to refer to it when you wish to do anything new with the framework.

Mark Pilgrim's Site. Again. By now, you should know enough HTML for this to read like a novel: http://diveintohtml5.info/
