### Challenge 2: Customize your Home Page

Now that you understand all that html code you copypasted in the last challenge, we'll move a step further.

1. Change the title of the web page from `Bootstrap 101 Template` to `{Your Name} | My Personal Web Page`
2. Create a Bootstrap `.container` in the page between the `<!-- CONTENT STARTS HERE -->` and `<!-- CONTENT ENDS HERE -->` comment tags
3. Inside this `.container`, create 3 `.row`s.
4. The first `.row` will welcome the user to your web page. Bootstrap `.jumbotron`s are good for bold welcome messages
5. The seccond `.row` will contain biographical data
6. The third `.row` should contain information about work and/or school
7. If you're in the mood, add a fourth `.row` for fun, random stuff about yourself.

**Important**

* Add at least one image to your page
* Embed at least one video from YouTube or audio track from SoundCloud
* Include a list of links to your online profiles, including GitHub if you have an account
* Is your page responsive? Head over to http://getbootstrap.com/css/ to learn about responsiveness. Look under "Grid System"
* Test your page on mobile by resiving your window. See if you like the layout
